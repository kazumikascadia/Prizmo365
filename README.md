**An Open-Source, Multipurpose Discord Bot**

## What is Prizmo
> [!WARNING]
> This bot is currently in its first beta build. Use at your own discretion.

Prizmo is a work in progress Discord bot built with a multipurpose mindset. It is currently in a open beta build and is fully accessible to the public at this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=734214062627356683&permissions=8&scope=bot+applications.commands)

Best of all, Prizmo is completely free and entirely open-source. You can find all of Prizmoâ€™s code in this Github repository, and you are completely free to use all of it. There are no current plans for monetization, nor are there any open ways to donate to the bot.

### Using Prizmo
At the moment, Prizmo is in its first beta build, and as such is fully available to be used by the public. Use this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=734214062627356683&permissions=8&scope=bot+applications.commands) to add the bot to your server.

Alongside this, since the code is all open-source, you are free to use all of it and create your own bot. Check the Sources and Libraries section for dependencies that are ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to use this repository. You can also utilize the sample data files to set up your bot; simply change the names of each of these files and input the proper information to your channel. Below is a list of what these files should be named:
1. Directory `sampledata` should be named `data`.
2. `sampledata/sstarboarddata.json` should be `data/starboarddata.json`
3. `sampledata/ssuggestdata.json` should be `data/suggestdata.json`
4. `sampledata/sguilddata.json` should be `data/guilddata.json`
5. `sampleconfig.json` should be `config.json`

### Namesake
In case you're curious, the name "Prizmo365" is a creation from long ago, when I was originally extremely interested in starting my own business (which I would have called Prism). As such, Prizmo comes from a name I used at the time online, as well as a name for an idea of a security bot for the company's Discord server. In August of 2020, I decided to begin the original Prizmo project, under the title "Prizmo365" - under the idea that it would be usable 365 days a year, 24/7. With time and change, the name stuck, and here we are.
