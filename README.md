Prizmo is a work in progress Discord bot built with a multipurpose mindset. It is currently in beta 2.3.7, with more features coming soon! 

This is a completely free and entirely open-source project. You can find all of Prizmoâ€™s code in this Github repository, and you are completely free to use all of it. There are no current plans for monetization, nor are there any open ways to donate to the bot.

1. Directory `sampledata` should be named `data`.
2. `sampledata/sstarboarddata.json` should be `data/starboarddata.json`
3. `sampledata/ssuggestdata.json` should be `data/suggestdata.json`
4. `sampledata/sguilddata.json` should be `data/guilddata.json`

6. `sampleleveldata.json` should be `leveldata.json`

Wiki coming soon!

### Namesake
In case you're curious, the name "Prizmo365" is a creation from long ago, when I was originally extremely interested in starting my own business (which I would have called Prism). As such, Prizmo comes from a name I used at the time online, as well as a name for an idea of a security bot for the company's Discord server. In August of 2020, I decided to begin the original Prizmo project, under the title "Prizmo365" - under the idea that it would be usable 365 days a year, 24/7. With time and change, the name stuck, and here we are.

## Contributions
Because Prizmo365 is an open-source Discord bot created by one developer, contributions are absolutely accepted and are even extremely useful. If you would like to contribute, you can request features and report bugs or vulnerabilities. Programming contributions will also be accepted; submit a pull request and it will most likely be accepted if it is a working and good change. You can also DM @kazumikascadia on Discord for more suggestions.

### Feature Requests
If you would like to request any features for this bot, please DM @kazumikascadia on Discord. My message requests are currently open and will remain that way. With this, please send a beginner message detailing who you are, or else I will likely not respond due to privacy concerns.

When providing bug reports, please provide exactly how you found the bug, where the bug is / may be located, and the release in which they occurred. If the release is not the most current, they may have been solved in a recent release; if they have not been, they should be solved by the next release.
